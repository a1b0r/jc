## A
You will find the file "hits.xls" attached.  
Put the data from the file into a mySQL-table and describe how you accomplished that.  

prep envierment to run on:
```bash
docker compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build 
```
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE JC;
USE JC;
CREATE TABLE hits (
  job_id INT,
  job_title VARCHAR(50),
  date_time DATETIME
);
```
export xls as csv and import via script:
```SQL
USE JC;
LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/hits.csv'
INTO TABLE hits
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```
or lazy via [PMA](http://localhost:8080/index.php) or any other GUI
## B
Develop a query which results in the columns title, the amount of hits per job, the point in time
where the first and the point in time where the last access occurred.

```SQL
SELECT job_title, COUNT(*) AS hits, MIN(date_time) AS first_access, MAX(date_time) AS last_access
FROM hits
GROUP BY job_title;
```
#### result:
| job_title | hits | first_access            | last_access             |
